    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA uses data from the World Bank Group to explore economic trends across different countries from 1965 to 2023. The dataset includes key factors such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, and government expenditure on education. The goal of this analysis is to discover patterns and relationships that emphasize economic performance in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this EDA, our goal is to identify key patterns and trends related to global economic inequality and development. The analysis will show which countries have reduced unemployment and increased GDP growth, as well as if investments in education correspond to these outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations (Rows): Each row in the dataset corresponds to a country and a specific economic indicator (e.g., GDP growth, government expenditure on education, or unemployment) for mulitple years(1965-2023). The rows are structured with country-level data, showing trends and changes in economic indicators over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes (Columns):\n",
    "Country Name: The name of the country.\n",
    "Country Code: A unique identifier for each country (ISO or similar).\n",
    "Series Name: The economic indicator (e.g., GDP growth, unemployment, government expenditure on education).\n",
    "Year Columns: Yearly data points from 1965 to 2023, where each column represents the recorded value of the economic indicator for that specific year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why was this dataset created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was created to track economic performance and trends in different countries over time. The data helps governments, policymakers, economists, and international organizations understand key economic metrics such as GDP growth, government expenditure on education, and unemployment rates, which can guide economic development strategies and interventions in different regions of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was funded and crafted by The World Bank, a global financial institution that supports development efforts in countries world-wide. Its mission is to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development so the World Bank regularly collects and publishes data on a wide range of economic indicators to aid in policy-making and development planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data availability and reliability: Some countries may not have consistent or complete data records due to political instability, inadequate infrastructure, or limited data collection capabilities. This can lead to missing or incomplete data for certain years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of indicators: The choice of economic indicators included in the dataset (e.g., GDP growth, unemployment, government expenditure) reflects the focus areas of development agencies and governments. I believe these indicators chosen are deemed critical and essential for assessing economic health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reporting standards: Differences in national reporting standards and data collection methods could lead to variations in data quality and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias in data recording: Some data points may reflect self-reported figures from governments, which could be subject to political influence or reporting biases, particularly in countries where transparency or accurate reporting is less enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data consisted of four datasets grouped by income level of the countries(low_income, lower_middle, upper_middle, high_income) to distinguish between developing and developed countries. Preprocessing was done to standardize economic indicators and ensure consistency across countries and years.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, only the relevant economic indicators—GDP growth, government expenditure on education, and unemployment—were retained. Rows missing essential information like Country Name, Country Code, or Series Name were removed. Year columns from 1960 to 1964 were excluded due to data quality issue, and non-numeric values like \"..\" were replaced with NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle missing values,linear interpolation was used to estimate missing data based on adjacent trends. Remaining NaN rows were dropped as there was too many missing data for linear interpolation to work well, and a new column, country_type, was added to label each country based on its income group. Finally, all datasets were merged into a single dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection for this type of dataset is typically done through government reporting mechanisms and international data collection efforts, not directly involving individuals. Governments or institutions contributing data likely understood that the information would be used for development assessments, economic planning, and research purposes. However, the individuals whose economic data are aggregated (e.g., unemployment figures) may not be aware of the specific data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The four original dataset that we merged along with the final_dataset is in the google drive. we have also uploaded it to github.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis**: The effect of government expenditure on education on GDP growth does not differ significantly between developing and developed countries \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis**: The effect of government expenditure on education on GDP growth is significantly greater in developing countries compared to developed countries \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context & Rationale:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Education is a well-established driver of economic growth because it builds human capital by enhancing individual's skill and productivity.For instance, in many developing countries, where access to quality education is limited, an increased in government spending on education can most definetely help bridge this gap in literacy and technical training, equipping more people to participate effectively in the labor force. Studies like Barro (1991) and Hanushek & Woessmann (2012) have shown that such investments lead to significant improvements in innovation and economic output, particularly in developing countries where baseline education levels are lower. For developing countries, increased government expenditure on education has the potential to address systemic deficits in human capital and creates significant improvements in economic output. Developed countries, on the other hand, may already have robust educational systems so it will result in smaller returns on additional expenditure. For example, in countries like India, government programs focused on primary and secondary education, such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All Movement), have contributed to higher school enrollment rates and long-term economic benefits. By contrast, in developed countries like Germany or the United States, where educational systems are already advanced and broadly accessible, additional spending on education often results in smaller marginal improvements, as the foundational infrastructure and access are already in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Plan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, a multiple regression analysis will be conducted where the dependent variable is GDP growth (annual %), and the independent variables are government expenditure on education (total % of GDP) and income class. Income class will be represented as a binary variable (1 = developing countries; 0 = developed countries), and we will include an interaction term between government expenditure on education and income class. This setup allows us to test whether the effect of education expenditure on GDP growth differs significantly between developing and developed countries. We will test the significance of the interaction term using a two-tailed t-test, where a p-value <= 0.05 will indicate that the effect of education expenditure on GPD growth is significantly different between developing and developed countries. Additionally, we will evaluate the magnitude and the direction of the coefficient to confirm whether the effect is stronger in developing countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2:** An increase in government expenditure on education reduces long-term unemployment rates more significantly in developing countries than in developed countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis**: The interaction between government expenditure on education and income class does not have a significant effect on unemployment rates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis**: The interaction between government expenditure on education and income class has a significant effect on unemployment rates, with a stronger reduction in unemployment rates in developing countries compared to developed countries \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context & Rationale:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Education enhances employability by providing individuals with skills that meet the demands of the job market, a relationship consistently highlighted in labor economics research (OECD, 2010; Psacharopoulos & Patrinos, 2004). For example, in developing countries like Kenya, investments in technical and vocational education programs, such as the Youth Empowerment Project, have helped bridge skill gaps and prepared young people for roles in industries like construction and technology, significantly reducing unemployment among youth. While both developing and developed countries benefit from increased education spending, the impact is often greater in developing nations. This is because many developing countries face a shortage of trained workers, and education initiatives can directly address these gaps. By contrast, in developed countries like Japan, where educational attainment is already high, additional spending may lead to smaller improvements, as the workforce is already equipped with advanced skills and labor markets tend to be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Plan:** \n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform a multiple regression analysis where the dependent variable is the unemployment rate (total % of labor force, modeled ILO estimate). The independent variables will include government expenditure on education (total % of GDP), year (to capture long-term trends), and income class. Income class will be represented as a binary variable (1 = developing countries) [low and lower middle-income], 0 = developed countries [upper middle and high-income]). We will create a interaction terms between income class and education expenditure to model differential effects between these variables. For testing, we will focus on the coefficients of the interaction terms between education expenditure and income class. For each interaction term, a two-tailed t-test will be conducted to test whether its coefficient is significantly different from zero. A p-value <= 0.05 will mean there is a significant effect. Additionally, we will examine the magnitude and sign of these coefficients to determine whether education spending has a stronger nagtive effect on unemployment in developing countries(low and lower middle-income groups) compared to developed countries (upper middle and high-income groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the long term effect, we will access whether the interaction term remains signifcant acorss different years by including a three-way interaction (Education Expenditure x Income Class x Year). This will allow us to analyze whether the impact of education expenditure on unemployment changes over time and whether this change varies between developing and developed countries.\n",

    "The data cleaning process involved multiple structured steps to ensure consistency, completeness, and proper formatting of the data for analysis. To address the research question, \"How does government expenditure on education impact long-term economic growth and unemployment in developing versus developed countries?\", the dataset was filtered to focus on three key variables. GDP growth (annual %) was selected as it serves as a fundamental measure of economic growth, reflecting the annual percentage increase in a country's economic output and providing insight into the broader economic impact of government policies. Government expenditure on education (total % of GDP) was included as it directly measures a country's investment in education relative to its economic output, capturing the priority placed on educational funding. Unemployment (total % of labor force, modeled ILO estimate) was chosen to assess labor market outcomes, particularly the effectiveness of economic and educational policies in addressing employment challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows missing essential identifying information, such as Country Name, Country Code, or Series Name, were removed to maintain data integrity. Columns corresponding to the years 1960 to 1964 were excluded because they contained too many missing values to be useful. Non-numeric placeholders, such as .., were replaced with NaN to enable numeric operations, and the year columns were converted to a numeric format for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear interpolation was applied to estimate missing values based on trends in adjacent data points. This method was chosen because it preserves the temporal continuity of the dataset, ensures smooth transitions between known values, and minimizes the bias that other methods, such as mean imputation, could introduce. After interpolation, any remaining rows with NaN values were dropped to create a fully complete dataset. To enable comparison across countries, a new column, country_type, was added, categorizing countries based on their income classification (e.g., low_income, lower_middle, upper_middle, and high_income). Finally, the individual datasets were merged into a single, unified dataset. This thorough process ensured that the dataset was prepared for meaningful analysis, addressing gaps and inconsistencies while maintaining the integrity of the trends across key variables.\n"

    "The regression shows a very low R-squared value of 0.011, indicating that only 1.1% of the variation in GDP growth is explained by the model. Education expenditure has a negative coefficient (-0.482), meaning higher spending on education is associated with lower GDP growth, which could reflect delayed effects or other confounding factors. The interaction term (0.406) suggests that the impact of education expenditure is more positive in developing countries. The negative coefficient for country_type_encoded (-1.315) indicates that developing countries generally have lower GDP growth compared to developed countries. While the coefficients are statistically significant, the model's explanatory power is weak, and further analysis such as testing for non-linear relationships or interactions with other variables to capture more complexity in the data or exploring time lags (e.g., education expenditure's impact on GDP growth after 5 or 10 years)is needed to better understand these relationships.\n",

For high-income countries, the base GDP growth rate is 5.45%, but each additional 1% of GDP spent on education is associated with a 0.48% decrease in growth. Low- and lower-middle-income countries have a lower base GDP growth rate due to the country type coefficient (-1.31%), but the interaction term (+0.41%) shows that education spending has a less negative impact in these countries compared to high-income ones. Outliers, such as countries experiencing unusually high growth or sharp recessions, may influence the model. These could include resource-rich nations with rapid growth or countries recovering from conflicts or crises. The negative coefficient for education spending might also reflect delayed returns on investment or specific contexts where increased spending coincides with economic challenges whihc we will later explained in our limitation section.\n"

The significant interaction term supports the alternative hypothesis, suggesting that the effect of education expenditure on GDP growth is stronger in developing countries compared to developed countries. However, the negative coefficient for education expenditure (-0.482) indicates an unexpected inverse relationship, potentially reflecting unaccounted factors such as inefficiencies in spending or lag effects.

    "The Random Forest model for analyzing the relationship between education expenditure and unemployment achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0579 and a high R-squared (R²) value of 0.8617. These results suggest that the model performs well in capturing the relationships within the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The low MSE indicates that the model's predictions for the unemployment rate (log-transformed) are, on average, very close to the observed values. This highlights the model's ability to effectively reduce prediction errors compared to simpler models like linear regression, which struggled to explain much of the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The high R-squared value of 0.8617 suggests that 86.17% of the variability in the unemployment rates can be explained by the variables included in the model. This indicates a strong predictive capability, with education expenditure (log-transformed), country type, and interaction terms playing significant roles in explaining unemployment trends."

    "The analysis provides insights into how government expenditure on education impacts long-term GDP growth and unemployment rates in developing and developed countries. For GDP growth, the findings from the linear regression suggest that education spending has a negative immediate impact, reflected in the negative coefficient for education expenditure. This may stem from delayed benefits, as the returns on educational investments often take years to materialize, particularly in developing countries where investments focus on infrastructure or younger populations. The interaction term indicates that this negative impact is less pronounced in developing countries, likely because these nations have more to gain from educational improvements. However, the low R-squared value highlights the complexity of GDP growth, which is influenced by numerous factors such as trade policies, political stability, and natural resource management. Random Forest analysis of GDP growth resulted in an R-squared of -0.356, indicating that it failed to explain variance effectively in this context, underscoring the challenges of modeling GDP growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "For unemployment, the linear regression results indicate a weak positive relationship between education expenditure and unemployment rates, which might reflect the mismatch between education systems and labor market demands, particularly in developing countries. Significant interaction terms highlight that the impact of education spending varies by country type, likely due to differences in labor market structures and the stages of economic development. Random Forest regression provided a stronger performance, with an R-squared of 0.86, suggesting it captured the non-linear relationships and complex interactions better than linear regression. These results demonstrate that the impact of education spending on unemployment is multifaceted, with effects shaped by broader structural factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers identified in the residual plots for both GDP growth and unemployment highlight events such as financial crises, rapid recoveries, or other country-specific conditions that the models fail to capture. These outliers suggest that economic relationships are highly context-dependent and that linear models may struggle to fully account for such variability. Random Forest offered improvements in capturing these dynamics, but further refinement is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the findings suggest that while education expenditure has an impact, its effects on GDP growth and unemployment are influenced by context, time lags, and structural factors. Developing countries stand to benefit the most in the long term from improving education systems, but short-term effects remain less evident. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, for Phase 5 we will focus on exploring additional non-linear models as we have seen linear regression may not be the best model to capture this data. we will also explore lagged effects, and feature engineering to improve model performance and provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics between education spending, economic growth, and labor market outcomes."

    "Missing Data: The dataset includes gaps, particularly among developing nations with less robust data collection, which were either excluded or filled using interpolation. This can lead to trends that may not accurately reflect real economic conditions, potentially skewing the results.\n",

    "Bias in Self-Reporting: Data from government sources may be prone to inaccuracies, especially in politically sensitive areas such as unemployment and GDP growth. Underreporting or overreporting, particularly in developing countries, could distort the findings. For example, informal labor markets may not be fully captured, and education spending may exclude inefficiencies or misallocations.\n",

They do not account for qualitative factors such as spending efficiency, allocation between education levels, or underemployment, particularly in developing economies.\n",
