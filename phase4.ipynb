    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations (Rows): Each row in the dataset corresponds to a country and a specific economic indicator (e.g., GDP growth, government expenditure on education, or unemployment) for mulitple years(1965-2023). The rows are structured with country-level data, showing trends and changes in economic indicators over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes (Columns):\n",
    "Country Name: The name of the country.\n",
    "Country Code: A unique identifier for each country (ISO or similar).\n",
    "Series Name: The economic indicator (e.g., GDP growth, unemployment, government expenditure on education).\n",
    "Year Columns: Yearly data points from 1965 to 2023, where each column represents the recorded value of the economic indicator for that specific year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why was this dataset created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was created to track economic performance and trends in different countries over time. The data helps governments, policymakers, economists, and international organizations understand key economic metrics such as GDP growth, government expenditure on education, and unemployment rates, which can guide economic development strategies and interventions in different regions of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was funded and crafted by The World Bank, a global financial institution that supports development efforts in countries world-wide. Its mission is to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development so the World Bank regularly collects and publishes data on a wide range of economic indicators to aid in policy-making and development planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data availability and reliability: Some countries may not have consistent or complete data records due to political instability, inadequate infrastructure, or limited data collection capabilities. This can lead to missing or incomplete data for certain years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of indicators: The choice of economic indicators included in the dataset (e.g., GDP growth, unemployment, government expenditure) reflects the focus areas of development agencies and governments. I believe these indicators chosen are deemed critical and essential for assessing economic health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reporting standards: Differences in national reporting standards and data collection methods could lead to variations in data quality and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias in data recording: Some data points may reflect self-reported figures from governments, which could be subject to political influence or reporting biases, particularly in countries where transparency or accurate reporting is less enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data consisted of four datasets grouped by income level of the countries(low_income, lower_middle, upper_middle, high_income) to distinguish between developing and developed countries. Preprocessing was done to standardize economic indicators and ensure consistency across countries and years.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, only the relevant economic indicators—GDP growth, government expenditure on education, and unemployment—were retained. Rows missing essential information like Country Name, Country Code, or Series Name were removed. Year columns from 1960 to 1964 were excluded due to data quality issue, and non-numeric values like \"..\" were replaced with NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle missing values,linear interpolation was used to estimate missing data based on adjacent trends. Remaining NaN rows were dropped as there was too many missing data for linear interpolation to work well, and a new column, country_type, was added to label each country based on its income group. Finally, all datasets were merged into a single dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection for this type of dataset is typically done through government reporting mechanisms and international data collection efforts, not directly involving individuals. Governments or institutions contributing data likely understood that the information would be used for development assessments, economic planning, and research purposes. However, the individuals whose economic data are aggregated (e.g., unemployment figures) may not be aware of the specific data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data.**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Null Hypothesis**: The effect of government expenditure on education on GDP growth does not differ significantly between developing and developed countries \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis**: The effect of government expenditure on education on GDP growth is significantly greater in developing countries compared to developed countries \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context & Rationale:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Education is a well-established driver of economic growth because it builds human capital by enhancing individual's skill and productivity.For instance, in many developing countries, where access to quality education is limited, an increased in government spending on education can most definetely help bridge this gap in literacy and technical training, equipping more people to participate effectively in the labor force. Studies like Barro (1991) and Hanushek & Woessmann (2012) have shown that such investments lead to significant improvements in innovation and economic output, particularly in developing countries where baseline education levels are lower. For developing countries, increased government expenditure on education has the potential to address systemic deficits in human capital and creates significant improvements in economic output. Developed countries, on the other hand, may already have robust educational systems so it will result in smaller returns on additional expenditure. For example, in countries like India, government programs focused on primary and secondary education, such as the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All Movement), have contributed to higher school enrollment rates and long-term economic benefits. By contrast, in developed countries like Germany or the United States, where educational systems are already advanced and broadly accessible, additional spending on education often results in smaller marginal improvements, as the foundational infrastructure and access are already in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Plan:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, a multiple regression analysis will be conducted where the dependent variable is GDP growth (annual %), and the independent variables are government expenditure on education (total % of GDP) and income class. Income class will be represented as a binary variable (1 = developing countries; 0 = developed countries), and we will include an interaction term between government expenditure on education and income class. This setup allows us to test whether the effect of education expenditure on GDP growth differs significantly between developing and developed countries. We will test the significance of the interaction term using a two-tailed t-test, where a p-value <= 0.05 will indicate that the effect of education expenditure on GPD growth is significantly different between developing and developed countries. Additionally, we will evaluate the magnitude and the direction of the coefficient to confirm whether the effect is stronger in developing countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis 2:** An increase in government expenditure on education reduces long-term unemployment rates more significantly in developing countries than in developed countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis**: The interaction between government expenditure on education and income class does not have a significant effect on unemployment rates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis**: The interaction between government expenditure on education and income class has a significant effect on unemployment rates, with a stronger reduction in unemployment rates in developing countries compared to developed countries \n",
    "\n",
    "**Context & Rationale:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Education enhances employability by providing individuals with skills that meet the demands of the job market, a relationship consistently highlighted in labor economics research (OECD, 2010; Psacharopoulos & Patrinos, 2004). For example, in developing countries like Kenya, investments in technical and vocational education programs, such as the Youth Empowerment Project, have helped bridge skill gaps and prepared young people for roles in industries like construction and technology, significantly reducing unemployment among youth. While both developing and developed countries benefit from increased education spending, the impact is often greater in developing nations. This is because many developing countries face a shortage of trained workers, and education initiatives can directly address these gaps. By contrast, in developed countries like Japan, where educational attainment is already high, additional spending may lead to smaller improvements, as the workforce is already equipped with advanced skills and labor markets tend to be more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Plan:** \n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform a multiple regression analysis where the dependent variable is the unemployment rate (total % of labor force, modeled ILO estimate). The independent variables will include government expenditure on education (total % of GDP), year (to capture long-term trends), and income class. Income class will be represented as a binary variable (1 = developing countries) [low and lower middle-income], 0 = developed countries [upper middle and high-income]). We will create a interaction terms between income class and education expenditure to model differential effects between these variables. For testing, we will focus on the coefficients of the interaction terms between education expenditure and income class. For each interaction term, a two-tailed t-test will be conducted to test whether its coefficient is significantly different from zero. A p-value <= 0.05 will mean there is a significant effect. Additionally, we will examine the magnitude and sign of these coefficients to determine whether education spending has a stronger nagtive effect on unemployment in developing countries(low and lower middle-income groups) compared to developed countries (upper middle and high-income groups).\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the long term effect, we will access whether the interaction term remains signifcant acorss different years by including a three-way interaction (Education Expenditure x Income Class x Year). This will allow us to analyze whether the impact of education expenditure on unemployment changes over time and whether this change varies between developing and developed countries.\n",

    "The data cleaning process involved multiple structured steps to ensure consistency, completeness, and proper formatting of the data for analysis. To address the research question, \"How does government expenditure on education impact long-term economic growth and unemployment in developing versus developed countries?\", the dataset was filtered to focus on three key variables. GDP growth (annual %) was selected as it serves as a fundamental measure of economic growth, reflecting the annual percentage increase in a country's economic output and providing insight into the broader economic impact of government policies. Government expenditure on education (total % of GDP) was included as it directly measures a country's investment in education relative to its economic output, capturing the priority placed on educational funding. Unemployment (total % of labor force, modeled ILO estimate) was chosen to assess labor market outcomes, particularly the effectiveness of economic and educational policies in addressing employment challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows missing essential identifying information, such as Country Name, Country Code, or Series Name, were removed to maintain data integrity. Columns corresponding to the years 1960 to 1964 were excluded because they contained too many missing values to be useful. Non-numeric placeholders, such as .., were replaced with NaN to enable numeric operations, and the year columns were converted to a numeric format for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear interpolation was applied to estimate missing values based on trends in adjacent data points. This method was chosen because it preserves the temporal continuity of the dataset, ensures smooth transitions between known values, and minimizes the bias that other methods, such as mean imputation, could introduce. After interpolation, any remaining rows with NaN values were dropped to create a fully complete dataset. To enable comparison across countries, a new column, country_type, was added, categorizing countries based on their income classification (e.g., low_income, lower_middle, upper_middle, and high_income). Finally, the individual datasets were merged into a single, unified dataset. This thorough process ensured that the dataset was prepared for meaningful analysis, addressing gaps and inconsistencies while maintaining the integrity of the trends across key variables.\n"

    "The analysis of GDP growth trends involves compares countries of different socioeconomic status from 1965 to 2023. The results indicate that all country types experienced similar GDP growth patterns, largely influenced by significant global events, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A significant finding here is a spike in GDP growth in 2021, specifically for upper-middle-income countries, which likely reflects economic recovery after the pandemic. The regression analysis showed that high-income and upper-middle-income countries tend to recover quicker from economic downturns, whereas developing countries face more significant challenges in achieving similar stability. This suggests that the economic stability in high-income regions is better equipped to handle global crisises."
