    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This EDA uses data from the World Bank Group to explore economic trends across different countries from 1965 to 2023. The dataset includes key factors such as unemployment rates, GDP growth, and government expenditure on education. The goal of this analysis is to discover patterns and relationships that emphasize economic performance in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this EDA, our goal is to identify key patterns and trends related to global economic inequality and development. The analysis will show which countries have reduced unemployment and increased GDP growth, as well as if investments in education correspond to these outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations (Rows): Each row in the dataset corresponds to a country and a specific economic indicator (e.g., GDP growth, government expenditure on education, or unemployment) for mulitple years(1965-2023). The rows are structured with country-level data, showing trends and changes in economic indicators over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes (Columns):\n",
    "Country Name: The name of the country.\n",
    "Country Code: A unique identifier for each country (ISO or similar).\n",
    "Series Name: The economic indicator (e.g., GDP growth, unemployment, government expenditure on education).\n",
    "Year Columns: Yearly data points from 1965 to 2023, where each column represents the recorded value of the economic indicator for that specific year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why was this dataset created?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was created to track economic performance and trends in different countries over time. The data helps governments, policymakers, economists, and international organizations understand key economic metrics such as GDP growth, government expenditure on education, and unemployment rates, which can guide economic development strategies and interventions in different regions of the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Who funded the creation of the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was funded and crafted by The World Bank, a global financial institution that supports development efforts in countries world-wide. Its mission is to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development so the World Bank regularly collects and publishes data on a wide range of economic indicators to aid in policy-making and development planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data availability and reliability: Some countries may not have consistent or complete data records due to political instability, inadequate infrastructure, or limited data collection capabilities. This can lead to missing or incomplete data for certain years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of indicators: The choice of economic indicators included in the dataset (e.g., GDP growth, unemployment, government expenditure) reflects the focus areas of development agencies and governments. I believe these indicators chosen are deemed critical and essential for assessing economic health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reporting standards: Differences in national reporting standards and data collection methods could lead to variations in data quality and coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias in data recording: Some data points may reflect self-reported figures from governments, which could be subject to political influence or reporting biases, particularly in countries where transparency or accurate reporting is less enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data consisted of four datasets grouped by income level of the countries(low_income, lower_middle, upper_middle, high_income) to distinguish between developing and developed countries. Preprocessing was done to standardize economic indicators and ensure consistency across countries and years.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, only the relevant economic indicators—GDP growth, government expenditure on education, and unemployment—were retained. Rows missing essential information like Country Name, Country Code, or Series Name were removed. Year columns from 1960 to 1964 were excluded due to data quality issue, and non-numeric values like \"..\" were replaced with NaN.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle missing values,linear interpolation was used to estimate missing data based on adjacent trends. Remaining NaN rows were dropped as there was too many missing data for linear interpolation to work well, and a new column, country_type, was added to label each country based on its income group. Finally, all datasets were merged into a single dataset for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection for this type of dataset is typically done through government reporting mechanisms and international data collection efforts, not directly involving individuals. Governments or institutions contributing data likely understood that the information would be used for development assessments, economic planning, and research purposes. However, the individuals whose economic data are aggregated (e.g., unemployment figures) may not be aware of the specific data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The four original dataset that we merged along with the final_dataset is in the google drive. we have also uploaded it to github.\n",

    "The data cleaning process involved multiple structured steps to ensure consistency, completeness, and proper formatting of the data for analysis. To address the research question, \"How does government expenditure on education impact long-term economic growth and unemployment in developing versus developed countries?\", the dataset was filtered to focus on three key variables. GDP growth (annual %) was selected as it serves as a fundamental measure of economic growth, reflecting the annual percentage increase in a country's economic output and providing insight into the broader economic impact of government policies. Government expenditure on education (total % of GDP) was included as it directly measures a country's investment in education relative to its economic output, capturing the priority placed on educational funding. Unemployment (total % of labor force, modeled ILO estimate) was chosen to assess labor market outcomes, particularly the effectiveness of economic and educational policies in addressing employment challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows missing essential identifying information, such as Country Name, Country Code, or Series Name, were removed to maintain data integrity. Columns corresponding to the years 1960 to 1964 were excluded because they contained too many missing values to be useful. Non-numeric placeholders, such as .., were replaced with NaN to enable numeric operations, and the year columns were converted to a numeric format for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear interpolation was applied to estimate missing values based on trends in adjacent data points. This method was chosen because it preserves the temporal continuity of the dataset, ensures smooth transitions between known values, and minimizes the bias that other methods, such as mean imputation, could introduce. After interpolation, any remaining rows with NaN values were dropped to create a fully complete dataset. To enable comparison across countries, a new column, country_type, was added, categorizing countries based on their income classification (e.g., low_income, lower_middle, upper_middle, and high_income). Finally, the individual datasets were merged into a single, unified dataset. This thorough process ensured that the dataset was prepared for meaningful analysis, addressing gaps and inconsistencies while maintaining the integrity of the trends across key variables.\n"

    "## GDP Growth Trends \n",
    "The analysis of GDP growth trends involves compares countries of different socioeconomic status from 1965 to 2023. The results indicate that all country types experienced similar GDP growth patterns, largely influenced by significant global events, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A significant finding here is a spike in GDP growth in 2021, specifically for upper-middle-income countries, which likely reflects economic recovery after the pandemic. The regression analysis showed that high-income and upper-middle-income countries tend to recover quicker from economic downturns, whereas developing countries face more significant challenges in achieving similar stability. This suggests that the economic stability in high-income regions is better equipped to handle global crisises."

    "## Unemployment Trends\n",
    "The unemployment trends from 1965 to 2023 show that upper-middle-income countries generally had higher unemployment rates after 1990, while high-income countries managed to maintain relatively stable and lower unemployment rates throughout the period. There is a noticeable sharp increase in unemployment for upper-middle-income countries after 2000, which could indicate labor market disruptions or economic instability in these regions. In contrast, low-income countries show significant variability, reflecting the instability of their labor markets. Overall, it suggests that high-income countries are more consistent in managing unemployment."
